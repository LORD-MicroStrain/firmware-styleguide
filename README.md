LORD Sensing Style Guides
===================

Every major open-source project has its own style guide: a set of conventions
(sometimes arbitrary) about how to write code for that project. It is much
easier to understand a large codebase when all the code in it is in a
consistent style.

“Style” covers a lot of ground, from “use lower case underscore for variable names” to
“never use global variables” to “never use exceptions.” This project
([firmware style guide](https://github.com/LORD-MicroStrain/firmware-styleguide)) links to the
style guidelines we use for LORD Sensing code. If you are modifying a project that
originated at LORD Sensing, you may be pointed to this page to see the style guides
that apply to that project.

This project holds the [C++ Style Guide][cpp].
